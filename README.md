# Cookbook-D
Cookbook-D is a partial port of the [Cookbook-hs](https://github.com/natepisarski/Cookbook-hs/) general-purpose code library to the [D programming language](https://dlang.org/). Most of the "general" functions are ported over, but the `Project` and `Recipe` wings like **Quill2** are not present here.

More than anything else, this library was an excuse to pick up and learn D, which turned out to be a very cool language - definitely better than C++ in my opinion.
